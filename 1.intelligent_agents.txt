- What is AI?
    - The automation of activities that we associate with human 
    thinking, activities such as decision-making, problem solving
    , learning
    - The study of how to make computers do things at which 
    at the moment people are better
    - The branch of computer science that is concerned with the
    automation of intelligent behaviour
    - The study  of mental faculties through the use of 
    computational models

- Agents and environments
    - Touring test
        - designed to provide a satisfactory operational 
        definition of intelligence
        - A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, 
        after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether 
        responses come from a person or a computer
        - The computer would need to possess the following capabilities
            - natural language processing : to enable it to 
            communicate successfully in English
            - knowledge representation : to store what it knows or hears
            - automated reasoning : to use the stored information to 
            answer questions and to draw new conclusions
            - machine learning : to adapt to new circumstances 
            and to detect and extrapolate patterns

    - Views of AI falls into four category
        - Thinking humanly: cognitive modeling approach
            - to study the actual working of human minds
                - psychological experiment : observing a person in 
                action; and through 
                - brain imaging : observing brain in action.
                - introspection : trying to catch our own thought as 
                they go by
        - Acting Humanly
            - Turing Test 
            - If "Can machine think?" then "Can machines behave intelligently?"

        - Thinking rationally
            - Normative or prescriptive rather than descriptive

            - Not all intelligent behaviors is mediated by logical deliberation
            - What is the purpose of thinking? What thoughts should I have?

        - Acting rationally : the rational agent approach
            - Rational behavior: doing the right thing
                - Right thing is expected to maximize goal achievement
                given the available information
            - Doesn't necessarily involve thinking
                - eg blinking reflex: but should rationally action
        
    - Rational Agent
        - An agent is something that perceives and acts
        - A rational agent is the one that acts to achieve the 
        best outcome
- Intelligent Agent
    - PAGE (Percepts, Actions, Goals, Environment)
        - Percepts : refer to the agents perceptual inputs at any given
        instance of time
            - Percept sequence is the complete history of everything 
            the agent has ever perceived
    - Performance Measure: evaluates the behaves in an environment
    - Task environment: specifications includes performance measure
        external environment, actuators, and sensors
    - Rational Agents 
        - Goals are specifiable by performance measure defining a numerical
        value for any environment history
        - Rational actions is whichever action maximizes the expected
        value of the performance measure given the percept sequence to date
            Rationality != Omniscient
            Rationality != Clairvoyant
            Rationality != Successful
    - Environment types
        - Competitive Vs Cooperative in multi agent environment
            - Chess is a competitive environment
            - Cooperative is something like taxi driving 
        - Deterministic Vs Stochastic
            - Deterministic: if the next state of envt can be completely
            determined by the current state and action executed by the agent
            - Stochastic: otherwise its Stochastic (if the environment is uncertain)
                - Taxi driving
        - Episodic Vs sequencial
            - Episodic: the agent experience is divided into small atomic episodes
                - the next episode doesnot depend on the actions taken by previous episode
            - Sequential: the current action could affect all future actions

        - Discrete Vs Continuous
            - This distinction applies to the state of the environment, the way time is 
            handled, and to the Percepts and actions of the agent
            - Discrete
                - Chess : has discrete set of percept s and actions 
            - Continuous
                - Taxi Driver : Continuous-State and Continuous-Time problem
                    - speed and location of the taxi
            
    - Agent program
        Agent = Agent + Architecuter
        - The job of AI is to design an agent program
        - We assume this agent program runs in some architecture
    
        - an agent is completely specified by by agent function
        mapping percept sequence to actions
        - One agent function is rational
        - An agent program takes a single percept as input, keeps internal state

            function skeletonAgent(percept): action {
                static: memory, the agent's memory

                memory<-updateMemory(memory, percept)
                action<-choseBestAction(memoy)
                memory<-updateMemory(memory, action)

                return action
            }
            
        - AIMA Code  
            - The code for each topic is divided into four catagories
                - agents: code for defining the agent types and programs
                - algorithms: code for the methods used by the agent programs
                - environments: code for defining environment types, simulations
                - domain: problem types, and instances for input to algorithms
